# FOOSBALL RESULTS PLATFORM #

Foosball Results Platform is a Lightweight easy-to-use platform which allows the storage of game results that are in the format 9-1, like football. It stores data in a hierarchy of text files, with an indexing file. The core language and funcctionality version 1 has just been released (20/12/2022), with a function for searching for results and creating new results. They are indexed by date.

### System Requirements ###
Must have Python >3.10.4 installed.     
Must have GRS LINK installed (in repo)


### Future Plans ###
In the future, I plan to create a multitude of support programs to aid this core functionality, and expand its features to being able to partly analyse game results, and save more data points per game with an ability to search for them in the future. Other things I plan to create are a website creator which gives the data a place, controlled by a python extension. Other things also include a terminal ap of the platform's own to use the core CLI language. The core language will also be adapted slightly and published as a python module to use in your own programs. I might also publish the core language's functions which help it run, like the file handlings mechanism as python modules to allow users to create a system based on this framework.

This will form a suite of applications which form a lightweight framework for a host of applications.
